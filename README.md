# watch-classifier
Predicts the brand of a watch given an image using a CNN

At the moment I have not deployed the project because I am having trouble finding a good host and fully understanding 
how to deploy a project that has specific dependencies. However, you can clone the repo, follow the instructions, and get setup locally
to try the project out.

## How to Setup Locally
1. Clone the repo
2. Make sure you have Python 3.7+ installed and Node.js installed
3. CD into the repo (root directory) and run "npm install" to install dependencies
4. In the terminal, run "pip install -r requirements.txt to install python dependencies
5. While in the root directory, open terminal and run "npm start" to launch React
6. If React throws errors regarding libraries, install those libraries (materialUI and axios should be the only libraries)
7. Open another terminal and run "python server.py" to start the local server
8. The project should be setup locally and you can test by uploading a picture to the React page.

## To-Do
